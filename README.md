# The Economy, Stupid!

"The Economy, Stupid!" is a macroeconomics simulation game that Insight Machines created as its very first project, more than 10 years ago. It was a venture into the world of macroeconomic simulations and serious games. The game runs on Java, version 8.0 or higher. For Windows users, there is a self-extracting package that contains both the game and a Java Runtime Environment - just for convenience. You will find the package [here](https://github.com/gholdys/TheEconomyStupid/blob/master/dist/theeconomystupid.exe). It is not an installer - just a self-extracting archive - so no Start Menu items etc will be created. After extracting the package, you can start the game with the `run.bat` file.

Linux and Mac users need to have JRE installed on their systems and download the game's .jar file from [here](https://github.com/gholdys/TheEconomyStupid/blob/master/dist/theeconomystupid-1.0.0.jar). Them simply run:
```java -jar theeconomystupid-1.0.0.jar```

The game was translated to Spanish by Hugo Sanchez, the owner of ["Simulación Política"](http://simulacionpolitica.blogspot.com/) - a blog devoted to games about political strategy and economics.
